# Welcome to Off Season Rugby
A website promoting Rugby safety for players between 5 and 20
Rugby safety is often an over looked element of the game outside of the normal season. Furthermore it is only as players progress to more professional environments that the issues of concussion awareness, tackle technique and a full understanding of the laws of the game become a part of the  training routine. Off season rugby offers players outside of professional ranks the opportunity to become more aware of these issues and progress their knowledge of the game in a an environment that promotes safety for themselves and others

# Testing
I tested my website on a laptop, tablet and smartphone using chrome and firefox browsers.

# Validating
Tested CSS and HTML on w3.org validator and no issues to report

# Unfixed bugs
When I ran the lighthouse report I was getting a performance result of below the pass mark. This had something to do with the cache and I was prompted to add a long cache lifetime to my browser which I could not do. I followed the instructions to do so but when I chose network I was not seeing any other option to extend the cache lifetime. I was also told to give images an explicit height and width which when I did made the images go out of sync.

# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits
I found this project very difficult to begin with. However I followed tutorials from here: https://codewithharry.com/ and I credit the entire re-design of my page from following his lessons on CSS and HTML
