                <h2>tackle technique</h2>
                <p class="border-left">Poor tackle technique is single biggest cause of injury on the rugby field. The game is getting
                    faster and players are getting bigger. It is more important than ever to not only tackle correctly, 
                    but also understand your responsibilities as the player making the tackle. We provide skills sessions with
                    a professional coach to show you how it's done, safely and effectively
                </p>

            <div class="column">
                <h2>concussion awareness</h2>
                <p class="border-center">Head injuries are far too common in rugby today and can have a serious impact on a players health
                    long after they hang up their boots. As with all contact sports, the risk of concussion is part and parcel. 
                    We at Off Season Rugby believe it is important to educate young players so as they become aware of the
                    risks and can identify the after effects of concussion
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
                <h2>rules and regulations</h2>
                <p class="border-right">We play a complicated game, it's not just all bash through like a bulldozer! The rules are constantly
                    being updated and for the aspiring professional it is vital to understand each and every aspect of the rule book. 
                    Gain a competitive advantage, surprise the referre with your knowledge, teach your coach a thing or two! 
                    It's ALWAYS a good idea to play by the rules!
